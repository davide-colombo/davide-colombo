My name is **Davide** and I'm writing a _journey about life_ called ["Hidden in plain sight"](https://github.com/davide-colombo/Hidden-in-Plain-Sight).

During the last 25 years I learned a lot about myself and others, and I think I have something to offer to significantly help other people along their journey.


## About my Journey

I can describe my journey as two parts:

- The first is centered about getting to know my body;
- The second and actual is centered around getting to know my mind.


## First part: the body

Since I was able to move my feet on the ground I fell in love with sports.

My journey starts as a little kid at the age of 5 playing soccer at the team in my little town.

In 20 years I had the chance to try many different sports from swimming, to basketball, rugby, archery, rafting, athletics, bodybuilding, motocross, mountain bike, most of them at a non competitive level, but everytime I approached a new discipline I rapidly ended up to be the most performant athlete.

Along the years I realized to be a very competitive person and I developed a strong discipline and resilience in sports as in life.

In 2016 I started my journey as a Bioengineer.

They were three years of hard times, long hours of lessons followed by hours of study.

I think that if I successfully achieved the Bachelor degree in 2019 fully on time, it is mainly due to the strong discipline and resilience I developed through sports. Of course there were other factors such as the full support of my family.

Aside University, on saturday night I worked as a waiter, not for economic purposes because I'm lucky to have (as stated above) a family that fully supports me and believes.

The reason I decide to start working was to be a little more independent and collect experience and for sure I did.

Along with studies and evening work, I started hitting to the gym four, five, six times a week consistently until early 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic spread.

I learned more about biology, about foods and nutrients, how to combine them, how to cook them, and especially about how my body react to them.

I had the chance over the years to learn more about my body and find the perfect routine for me.

But most importantly, those years were the key to test my mind under huge amount of stress and pressure.

Unsurprisingly I learned how to cope with stressful situations.


## Second part: the mind
