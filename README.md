My name is **Davide** and I'm writing a _journey about life_ called ["Hidden in plain sight"](https://github.com/davide-colombo/Hidden-in-Plain-Sight).

During the last 25 years I learned a lot about myself and others, and I think I have something to offer to significantly help other people along their journey.


## About my Journey

I can describe my journey as two parts:

- The first is centered about getting to know my body;
- The second and actual is centered around getting to know my mind.


## First part: the body

Since I was able to move my feet on the ground I fell in love with sports.

My journey starts as a little kid at the age of 5 playing soccer at the team in my little town.

In 20 years I had the chance to try many different sports from swimming, to basketball, rugby, archery, rafting, athletics, bodybuilding, motocross, mountain bike, most of them at a non competitive level, but everytime I approached a new discipline I rapidly ended up to be the most performant athlete.

Along the years I realized to be a very competitive person and I developed a strong discipline and resilience in sports as in life.

In 2016 I started my journey as a Bioengineer.

They were three years of hard times, long hours of lessons followed by hours of study.

I think that if I successfully achieved the Bachelor degree in 2019 fully on time, it is mainly due to the strong discipline and resilience I developed through sports. Of course there were other factors such as the full support of my family.

Aside University, on saturday night I worked as a waiter, not for economic purposes because I'm lucky to have (as stated above) a family that fully supports me and believes.

The reason I decide to start working was to be a little more independent and collect experience and for sure I did.

Along with studies and evening work, I started hitting to the gym four, five, six times a week consistently until early 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic spread.

I learned more about biology, about foods and nutrients, how to combine them, how to cook them, and especially about how my body react to them.

I had the chance over the years to learn more about my body and find out my perfect daily routine after many trials and errors.

But most importantly, those years were the key to test my mind under huge amount of stress and pressure.

Unsurprisingly I learned how to cope with stressful situations.


## Second part: the mind

The COVID-19 pandemic pushes me to completely shift the way I was living my day.

I started in late 2019 my master degree in Bioengineering in presence to finish the remaining two years from home.

If on one side there was the disadvantage of having less human relationships, those years serves me to make a crucial discovery: time.

I started to wake up at 6 AM to study extra material.

As long as I finished the lessons I was used to study and dedicate the remaining time to learn more.

I started by searching on YouTube material about the courses to better understand the subjects and that quickly escalate to a huge expansions from psychology, to self-growth, marketing, neuro-biology, anatomy, foods and nutrients, workouts, habits, human skills, economy, politics, philosophy, ecology, supply chain, design, entrepreneurship.

I wanted to learn as much as I can about the World because I think that _knowledge is power_ and you are not _truly free_ without having such knowledge.

Because ultimately being free is the ability to make solid decision by yourself, isn't it? And knowledge is a prerequisite for that.

And I think that in the last 4 years I covered an extensive knowledge about that.

**Don't get me wrong**: I don't want to have the arrogance to say that I understand everything. 

What I can say with a reasonable degree of certain is that I know more than the average person and I will not stop and never intended to.

I successfully concluded my master degree in early 2022, while I was already working at ["Switch Academy"](https://switchacademy.com/), a startup in my humble opinion brilliantly conducted by my friend Vincenzo Di Pietro, who asked me to join him along his journey.

I learned a lot during that experience, especially I learned more about clear communication, commitment, ownership, taking smart decision, prioritize time, organize work.

It was a pleasure time and I'm thankful for having had that opportunity, especially because it open my mind about what I want to do in my life.

During my years at University I discover a strong passion and an innate affinity to programming.

After the experience at Switch Academy I decided to prepare to become a Software Engineer.

I know that I was not ready so I started to practice and learn more, especially about the low-level details of a computer system. That was enlighting.

I started looking at the Assembly code, write C programs, learn how the compiler works, and I rapidly ended up having a huge gallery of high-quality material on my phone's notes (I intend to share it!) and an extensive codebase in my ["C programming"](https://github.com/davide-colombo/cprogramming) repository.
