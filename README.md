My name is **Davide**, I'm a Bioengineer, I have been practicing sports for 20 years, I worked as a waiter, worked in the early days of a Startup.

I have lost friends, and made various mistakes.

My journey has been going on for 25 years now, I changed many shapes, evolved many times, and still evolving.

I'm writing a collection of _thoughts about life_ with the hope to inspire people to look at the World from a different perspective.

It's called ["Hidden in plain sight"](https://github.com/davide-colombo/Hidden-in-Plain-Sight/blob/master/README.md).


## About my Journey

I can describe my journey as two parts.

**The first** centered on sports. I learned a lot about food, improving performance, sleep, recovery, discipline, but most importantly I learned the limits and reactions of my body.

**The second** centered on the "mind". I learned to control my emotions, to resonate with other people, to listen to them. I become more aware of myself, my thoughts, my sensations. I learned to point the finger to myself instead of pointing it to others. I discover the forgotten doctrine of "deep thinking".


## First part: the body

Since I was able to move my feet on the ground I fell in love with sports.

My journey starts as a little kid at the age of 5 playing soccer at the team in my little town.

In 20 years I had the chance to try many different sports from swimming, to basketball, rugby, archery, rafting, athletics, bodybuilding, motocross, mountain bike, most of them at a non-competitive level, but everytime I approached a new discipline I rapidly ended up to be the most performant athlete.

Along the years I realized to be a very competitive person and I developed a strong discipline and resilience in sports as in life.

In 2016 I started my journey as a Bioengineer.

They were three years of hard times, long hours of lessons followed by hours of study.

I think that if I successfully achieved the Bachelor degree in 2019 fully on time together with a little part of colleagues, it was mainly due to the strong discipline and resilience developed through sports. Of course there were other factors such as the full support of my family.

Aside University, I worked as a part-time waiter for a couple of years.

I decide to start working to not weigh on the shoulders of my parents (_or at least weigh less_) and collect experience and for sure I did.

Along with studies and evening work, I started hitting the gym four, five, six times a week consistently until early 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic spread.

In three years I totally transformed my body.

And to do that I learned more about biology, foods and nutrients, how to combine them, how to cook them, and especially about how my body react to them.

I learned how to optimize sleep, how to optimize recovery, the importance of having a stable routine.

But most importantly, those years were the key to found my limits and I learned a lot about how to organize time and manage stressful situations.


## Second part: the mind

The COVID-19 pandemic pushes me to completely shift the way I was living my day.

I started in late 2019 my master degree in Bioengineering in presence to finish the remaining two years from home.

If on one side there was the disadvantage of having less human relationships, those years serves me to make a crucial discovery: time.

I started to wake up at 6 AM to study extra material.

As long as I finished the lessons I was used to study and dedicate the remaining time to learn more.

I started by searching on YouTube material about the courses to better understand the subjects and that quickly escalate to a huge expansions from psychology, to self-growth, marketing, neuro-biology, anatomy, foods and nutrients, workouts, habits, human skills, economy, politics, philosophy, ecology, supply chain, design, entrepreneurship.

In the past 3 years I radically changed the way I view myself, other people, and the World we live in.

### Master degree in Bioengineering and Startup experience

I successfully concluded my master degree in early 2022, while I was already working at ["Switch Academy"](https://switchacademy.com/), a startup which delivers all-in-one and customized career acceleration plans to help people boost their careers.

I learned a lot during that experience, especially I learned more about clear communication, commitment, ownership, taking smart decision, prioritize time, organize work.

It was a pleasure time and I'm thankful for having had that opportunity, especially because it open my mind about what I want to do in my life.

### Computer science

I love technology. I grew up in a World that was gradually evolving under technology. Today most of the objects around us have a chip inside that is running software.

I discover "_what is programming_" during the years at university and I had the chance to face some engineering problems.

For example, I used Tensorflow library developed at Google to train a Neural Network on chest x-ray images of children to detect pneumonia.

I took an _optional_ course on "_Information Theory and Cybersecurity_" that completely changes the way I was looking at technology. I took a course on microprocessors and that too fascinates me.

Aside the courses I started to watch YouTube videos from _Robert C. Martin, Martin Fowler, Kent Beck, Kevlin Henney, Chandler Carruth, Scott Meyer, Ulrich Drepper, Mike Acton, Jim Keller, Chris Lattner, John Carmack, Donald Knuth_.

I read blog posts. I bought books.

I learned about computer's memory, caches, compiler optimizations, linker.

I learned about branch prediction, CPU architecture.

I learned about Data Oriented Design.

I learned about data structures, abstraction layers, interfaces.

It was especially the concept of "abstraction layers" that radically changed my mind about software.

I used the C programming language to make practice. I also look at the Machine instructions generated by the compiler to truly understand what was happening under the hood.

I used Git to put my code under version control and share the repository on GitHub. You can find it here: ["C programming"](https://github.com/davide-colombo/cprogramming).

### Plan for the Future

With the beginning of the new year (2023) I started to consolidate and write what I learned about life through my journey, thinking deeply about the World, humanity and how I shifted the way I view the World.

Because, in all honesty, the side effect of having done a deep dive into my self for roughly 20 years was the prioritization of my needs.

It's time to share with other people my experience, what I learned about the World, and hopefully help them and humanity thrive.

### Career

My goal is to start a career as a Software Engineer at Google.

I'm a Bioengineer, I love applying technology to solve challenging problems, to create innovative solutions to help people.
