My name is Davide and I'm writing a journey about life called "Hidden in plain sight" (here).

Who am I?

Since I was able to move my feet on the ground I fell in love with sports.

My journey starts as a little kid at the age of 5 playing soccer at the team in my little town.

While I was growing I had the chance to try many different sports from swimming, to basketball, rugby, archery, rafting, athletics, bodybuilding, motocross, mountain bike, most of them at a non competitive level, but everytime I approached a new discipline I rapidly ended up to be the most performant athlete.
