My name is Davide and I'm writing a journey about life called "Hidden in plain sight" (here).

Who am I?

Since I was able move on my feet I love sports.

My journey starts as a little kid at the age of 5 playing soccer in a team of my little town. 

While I was growing I tried many different sports from swimming, to basketball, to rugby, to archery, to rafting, to athletics, to motocross, to mountain bike, most of them at a non competitive level as soccer, but everytime I approached a new discipline I ended up to be the most performant athlete.
