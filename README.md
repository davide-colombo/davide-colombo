My name is Davide and I'm writing a journey about life called "Hidden in plain sight" (here).

Who am I?

Since I was able to move my feet on the ground I fell in love with sports.

My journey starts as a little kid at the age of 5 playing soccer at the team in my little town.

In 20 years I had the chance to try many different sports from swimming, to basketball, rugby, archery, rafting, athletics, bodybuilding, motocross, mountain bike, most of them at a non competitive level, but everytime I approached a new discipline I rapidly ended up to be the most performant athlete.

Along the years I realized to be a very competitive person and I developed a strong discipline and resilience in sports as in life.

In 2016 I started my journey as a Bioengineer.

They were three years of hard times, long hours of lessons followed by hours of study.

I think that if I successfully achieved the Bachelor degree in 2019 fully on time, it mainly due to the strong discipline and resilience I developed through sports.

Aside University, on saturday night I worked as a waiter, not for economic purposes because I'm lucky to have a family that fully supports me and believes in me during my studies.

The reason I decide to start working was to be a little more independent and collect experience and for sure I did.

Along with studies and evening work, I started hitting to the gym four, five, six times a week consistently until early 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic spread.
